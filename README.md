# ML-Lab-Codes
My name is Chetan Talele (21BCE7893) and this repository contains all codes of my Machine Learning Lab from Winter Sem 2022-23.

### The list of projects covered in this repository is :
1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file
2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples
3. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm consider weather dataset.
4. Consider the Titanic dataset, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. Using Random Forest asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.
5. Implement Linear regression on IRIS dataset
6. Implement Logistic Regression for digit recognition
7. Implement Support Vector Machine for digit recognition and compare the accuracy with logistic regression
8. SVM Multiclass classification categorizing news article to sports, politics, economics, or social
9. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the na√Øve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task.
10. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets. K-NN and Weighted- KNN classifiers
